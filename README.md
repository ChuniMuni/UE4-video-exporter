# Functionality

- Converts a video file to WMV 720p 25fps for playback in shipped Unreal Engine builds.

Installation

- Unzip, ensure ffmpeg.exe is in the same folder as ue4-wmv-convert.
- If you have a 32-bit PC, delete ffmpeg.exe and rename ffmpeg.x86.exe to ffmpeg.exe.

# Usage

- Drag your video file onto to the ue4-wmv-convert.bat file provided.

# Tweaking Export Parameters

- Open "ue4-wmv-convert" in a text editor.
- "-q:v 4" determines the quality. 
- We recommend keeping this value between 2 and 5. 2 being higher quality compression, and 5 being lower quality compression
